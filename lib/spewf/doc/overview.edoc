@doc The spewf application is a yaws-based web framework which enables
a programmer to write a web application using a simple event-based
model where he or she can assume that they are communicating with
only one client. The programmer implements a callback module complying
with the {@link spewf_session} behavior, and the web communication,
request multiplexing, and HTML generation associated with maintaining
the session are taken care of. See the {@link webecho} module
for an example.
